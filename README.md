# DATA-dog-ratings-data-wrangling
In this project, I use Python and its libraries to wrangle data which involves
-  Gathering data from a variety of sources and formats.
-  Assessing its quality and tidiness.
-  Cleaning it.

I also store, analyze, and visualize the wrangled data.

One of the datasets used is the tweet archive of the Twitter user @dog_rates (aka WeRateDogs).  The Twitter account rates people’s dogs with humorous commentary.  The other data I use in this project is other additional tweet JSON data (which I get from querying the Twitter API using Python’s Tweepy library) and a neural network file that classifies dog breeds.
